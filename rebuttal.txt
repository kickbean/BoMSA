We thank the reviewers for their general positive feedbacks. We address concerns below.

To Reviewer 1: We have clarified the ¡°number of layer¡± and ¡°feature concatenation¡± issues in the text. The corresponding model adopted by the previous work is also added to the result table. Although it is true that the best performance is due in part to a more advanced model (e.g. Deep19), it is impressive that DAG-CNN could still achieve a considerable amount of gain given less room for improvement. This suggests that, under our architecture, both model complexity and multi-scale features are two parallel paths for improving performance. It is unclear if the performance gain for other approaches will match DAG-CNN when switching to an advanced model. 

To Reviewer 2: We agree with the reviewer about evaluations on object recognition datasets. We are currently conducting experiments on large-scale object recognition tasks (ImageNet) and fine-grain classifications. We are in hope of including more results in the Camera-ready, if accepted.

To Reviewer 3: We have reported the results for different-sized pooling windows and updated the corresponding text. Please see the manuscript for details.
